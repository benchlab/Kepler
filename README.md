# Kepler
Kepler Is The Global Identity Manager For Everything From Objects (Files, Data and Media), to Bench Computers, dApps, Users, Wallets and More Across The Bench Network. 

## Under Development 
Kepler is currently under development in the `development` branch. 

## What Purpose Will Kepler Serve?
Kepler's sole job is to create UIDs for anything across the Bench Network, from [Neutron](https://github.com/benchlab/neutron)-based decentralized networks (RootChains, SideChains and dappChains), [Aero](https://github.com/benchlab/aero) Objects (Files, Data and Media), [Nova](https://github.com/benchlab/nova) Compute Nodes (Bench Computers), dApps, hardware resources from [Nova](https://github.com/benchlab/nova) Compute Nodes (Bench Computers), BenchWallet addresses and users within the Bench network. Anything and everything on the Bench Network, can be identified and truly brings together a network that will never be controlled by a single entity.   

# What Is benOS
[benOS](https://github.com/benchlab/benos) is a decentralized operating system, originally based on Linux, uses some design strategies from [RedoxOS](https://github.com/redox-os) and even some design concepts from [OpenStack](https://github.com/openstack), [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and [EOS](https://github.com/eosio). Although we utilize some of their design strategies, benOS is completely custom from a codebase perspective. 

benOS has many components that make the wheels turn. Below are a list of those components:
